# Advent of Code 2023 (in rust)

## Quick Start

```console
$ cd advent-2023/

# run tests
$ cargo test

# cargo run will not work
```

## Advanced Setup

This program requires some inputs to run, Please use your AOC inputs when running this program. Format then and place in the `/src/inputs` folder.

Format: `input-{day_num}.txt`

Note: I pad my input names with 0's but it should work just fine with a single number.
